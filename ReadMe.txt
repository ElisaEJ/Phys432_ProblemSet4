Python Codes: 
	- PS4_Q3.py : contains the python code that solves problem #3 from 
			assignment 4. This means that it is a solver for the 
			advection equation. It compares the FTCS method to the 
			Lax-Friedrichs method. 

	- PS4_Q4.py: contains the python code that solves problem #4 from 
			assignment 4. This is a solver for the advection and 
			diffusion equation. It allows us to compare the effects 
			for two different values of diffusion coefficients side 
			by side.
